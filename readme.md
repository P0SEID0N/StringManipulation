String Manipulation Lib

To run:

1. run npm i to install dependencies (required for test suite to work)
2. run node index.js or npm run to run the project
3. The project will prompt you in the example case for a word, after it does its work and submits to you an answer the project will stop and you must use node index.js or npm start to do another iteration.

To run test cases simply run npm test and JEST will run all of the included tests.
